# The Structural Interpretation of Computer Programs 

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. This first course concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. In CS 61A, We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.
